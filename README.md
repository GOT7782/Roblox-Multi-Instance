Usually you could only play one game per computer. Fortunately, this bypasses that limit. Now you can play more than 100 games on your computer. Maybe even fill a server with your alts.

### Instructions

* Open the software before any game
* Now that the software is opened, join a game.
* Go back to the game's website then logout. Do not close your game.
* Log in with a new account. You can not use an account that is already in a game.
* Join a game or even join the same game as your other account. You should then see you have another game running at the same time.
* Repeat steps 3, 4, and 5. You can now have unlimited games open!
